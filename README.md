# What is this?!

My fun and practice! Smaller projects that don't quite deserve their own space, but just fun enough I'd like to put 
them up here.

Currently my projects include:

1) Zodiac Love Calculator App
    calculates the likelihood of a harmonious union with your lover!
    written in C

    written in Java, using MVC
